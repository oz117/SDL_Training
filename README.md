# SDL_Training
I am trying to learn SDL, for that I am using the tutorial from http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/
found on the SDL site.
This is my way of doing the tutorial, I only keeped a few things (images mostly).
I don't think I have the cleanest of codes, but hey! I am learning.
If you any advice contact me, I will be more than happy to see how you would do it :)
